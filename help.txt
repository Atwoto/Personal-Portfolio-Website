Update the navigation bar behavior on my portfolio site:

On desktop view (≥1024px width):

Show the full navigation menu (Projects, Skills, About, Contact) inline in the header.

Hide the hamburger menu icon.

On mobile and tablet view (<1024px width):

Show the hamburger menu icon.

Hide the inline nav links.

Ensure the hamburger expands into a clean mobile menu with smooth animation.

Keep styling consistent with the current header (same fonts, colors, and alignment).

Update my portfolio website with the following changes:

Testimonials Section ("What Organizations Say")

Add smooth horizontal scrolling animation for the testimonial cards.

The testimonials should scroll continuously from right to left in a carousel-style loop.

Include navigation controls (arrows or dots) so users can pause/scroll manually if they want.

Ensure the animation is responsive and smooth on desktop and mobile.

Footer Section

Replace the current text: “Trusted by 50+ businesses to automate their workflows” with:
“Trusted by 10+ innovative companies to automate their workflows”.

Replace the placeholder company names (TechFlow, DataCorp, AutomateXYZ, FlowMaster) with the same real companies shown under Trusted by Innovative Companies (e.g., Bills on Solar, TVG, Sambright, Self Mind, Digital Qatalyst, Tunza Jamii Properties, Sambright Limited Company).

Align styling so it matches the rest of the portfolio’s branding.
