Duka Insights AI Chatbot (POC)
Proof of Concept for a business intelligence assistant

Problem: Business owners lacked quick access to real-time, actionable insights across sales, customers, and inventory.

Solution: Built a POC chatbot in n8n integrated with Google Gemini and multiple APIs that:

Interprets natural language questions

Routes queries to the correct data sources

Fetches analytics in real time

Generates structured insights (financial breakdowns, comparisons, recommendations)

Outcome: Demonstrated the potential for an on-demand AI assistant to accelerate decision-making, with promising early results in analytics delivery and user engagement.
